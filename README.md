Lapis256
========

Lapis256 is a simple 256 colorscheme with:

- moderate contrast between background and text
- soft contrast between many common syntax elements
- lots of blue
- GUI support as of 2019 (thanks to [toastal](https://github.com/toastal))

(C++ function color requires adding a custom "syn match" to .vim/after/syntax/c.vim file, or similar, then mapping to Function: "hi def link cppFuncDef Function")
